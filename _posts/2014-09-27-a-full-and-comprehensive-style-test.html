<p>After returning to this area, I began offering house cleaning services. I feel that having a clean home just makes the home so much more enjoyable. In addition to being hard-working, flexible, and reliable, I am also insured. I'm happy to do anything from single cleanings to scheduled upkeep visits. Please feel free to reach me at andrewcleansvt@gmail.com or call 802-377-0240 with any questions you might have. Right now, I am offering a 10% discount for first cleanings! I offer both conventional and eco-cleaning products depending on your preferences.</p>
